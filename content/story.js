storyContent.push("A car door slams. You rush to your feet, shoving aside the book you've been reading as you join the rest of your family and the dog in a mad scramble for the door. She's here! Your sister, Beth, has been away at school, and with your own infrequent vacations, it's been ages since you've seen her. You rush out to join the hugfest on the driveway, when you pull up short. The young woman getting out of the car has turned toward you, laughing, arms extended for a hug, but that young woman is not your sister. You're confused. A quick scan shows no one else in the car. Before you can react, your dog has jumped up to claim the woman's attention, whining the way he only ever did for your sister. 'What are you standing there for? Come over her and give Beth a hug!' your mother chides. Your confusion gives way to a deepening sense of horror. You shake your head to clear it, but no amount of squinting will change fact. That is NOT your sister."); //1
storyContent.push("'Um, hello? Is this some kind of joke or something? Because it's not funny.' Well, you've got their attention. Your family stares at you, looking as confused as you feel. You watch their faces carefully, expecting a smile to crack any minute as they 'fess up and drop the gag. No one's lip so much as twitches. You're getting impatient; you've been looking forward to seeing Beth for weeks now. 'Come on guys, enough's enough. Who is this and where's Beth?' The stranger is watching you with an odd expression on her face. 'I'm right here,' she says softly, and everyone else nods cautiously. You scoff, really beginning to get angry now. 'Drop the game! You're clearly not; anyone can see!' Your parents are looking really concerned now, and deep down you know they aren't that good at acting. 'I mean you can all see, right? She's NOT the same person. She's not Beth! What's the matter with all of you? Why is no one else upset about this? Where's Beth?!'"); //2
storyContent.push("Your family stares at you in horror. Maybe you really are as crazy as their faces imply. 'Am I the only one who sees the difference?' You start to lose your conviction. 'I haven't been away that long, have I?' you mumble to yourself. 'Honey, are you feeling alright?' Your mom's voice is much too gentle. 'I'm fine,' you say, but it sounds weak even to you. You look hard at the young woman standing next to your parents. You don't recognize her in the slightest. More than that, you have a very vivid recollection of what your sister Beth should look like, and THAT is definitely not it."); //3
storyContent.push("'Either this is some kind of bad joke, or you've all gone mad,' you say firmly. 'But that woman is not my sister.' Everything seems to happen over your head after that. Your mom turns around and must have communicated something to the rest of your family, because everyone begins to move. Your dad puts a gentle arm around your shoulders. 'Let's move this into the family room,' he says, steering you before you can protest. You hear rushed whispers behind you, but your siblings and fake sister follow. You want to protest again when they let the strange woman go unchallenged, but let it pass. Your dad ushers you into a seat and you're left alone for a moment. There's a flurry of activity belying the sense of forced calm and cheer in your mother's tone when she comes to speak to you. 'Sweetie, what do you say we go for a quick drive?' You aren't really given the chance to say no, and 20 minutes later you and your parents are pulling in at the local hospital. 'Why are we here?' you ask suspiciously. Your mom's smile wobbles slightly. 'Oh, I thought we'd drop in with an old friend of mine. You don't mind, do you?' Your heart sinks. You know the truth. They're here for you."); //4
storyContent.push("From then on, your life becomes a constant stream of doctors, psychiatric visits, and medicine. You're quickly determined to be unfit to be on your own, and forced to move back into your parent's house or find a monitored living center. It feels weird to be back in your childhood room, and you chafe at the dependence. Your diagnosed with acute paranoia among a plethora of other things; you stop keeping track when each doctor concocts a brand new list. For a while, you're sure there's nothing wrong with you. You swear nothing could convince you otherwise, and you never can shake the feeling of disbelief around your sister, but with enough therapy and medication you are eventually able to reconcile her presence in the family. Despite your improvements, you have to attend group sessions for the rest of your foreseeable future, and it isn't just the paranoia when you note how much the drugs have changed your personality. You notice, you just can't quite bring yourself to care."); //5
storyContent.push("'Haha, wow,' you laugh nervously. 'Beth. Of course it's you. I'm sorry, it must be the heat. What are the symptoms of heat stroke again?' You sway on your feet for good measure, and it works. Your mom is immediately rushing forward to fawn over you, sending your brother to fetch a glass of water. You glance over her shoulder at your sister. She still doesn't look right, but you let your mother worry over you. After supervising your consumption of no less than 4 glasses of water, she finally sends you off to a cool, dark room to rest. You doze on and off, largely out of boredom, until you eventually slip into a deep sleep. You wake hours later with a start; the door is open, and you squint to make out who it is in the faint light."); //6
storyContent.push("You look up into the face of your 'sister', but the difference is even more stark now, and you wonder how anyone could have confused this woman for Beth. 'Siblings are always so inquisitive,' she sighs delicately. 'And for once, you were right. Too bad no one will ever believe you!' Her smile sends a shiver down your spine. Before you have the chance to respond, her outline blurs and she starts to glow, brighter and brighter until you can't look directly at her. Somewhere in the light, something moves...something much bigger than the woman who had been standing there previously. You recoil in horror and think about running, but it's too late. The light starts reaching toward you, and the last thing you hear is a distorted approximation of your sister's voice: 'Don't worry. Everything will be revealed once you become one of us.'"); //7
storyContent.push("'Of course! I've missed you, Beth; it's been so long.' If your enthusiasm is somewhat lacking, no one comments. You gingerly offer the stranger a hug, wincing at the contact. As you follow the group into the house, it starts to sink in that no one else notices a problem. At all. The strange woman is answering questions and filling everyone in with stories about her friends. Beth's friends, you realize. You recognize the names from Beth's social media tags. The rest of the day, you surreptitiously watch everyone's faces for anything out of the ordinary. There's nothing. You start to wonder if you're going crazy. But you're so sure that isn't your sister. You're doing the dishes after dinner when inspiration strikes: Photos! You can compare photos of Beth with this stranger and confirm she isn't the same person! Everyone will notice then."); //8
storyContent.push("You're not entirely confident in your sanity at the moment, and besides, two heads are better than one. The next question is who to choose as your second head. It has to be someone trustworthy, and someone who's known Beth long enough to be able to see the difference as clearly as you do. That narrows it down to either family or a friend."); //9
storyContent.push("You log onto social media and click to Beth's profile. You are instantly comforted to see her REAL face smiling back at you. That's the sister you know, not the stranger currently staying in Beth's room. You click to her friends list, and your mouse hovers back and forth over several names. Who you pick could give you more information about where the real Beth has gone."); //10
storyContent.push("You scan through the list to see who is online. A little green dot appears next to Rick, Beth's third grade crush and longtime best friend, and you waste no time messaging him. 'Hey,' you start, 'so this might sound weird...' You lay out the whole problem, and even attach a stealth photo you snagged of imposter-Beth earlier that evening. You watch the screen anxiously: 'RickRollinKing59 is typing.' Finally, you get his response. 'Hey long time no see! nice to hear from u. not sure I see what ur sayin. looks normal to me. evyerthing ok?' Your heart sinks. You respond back with something generic, and exit the message. How could Rick not see the difference? It's as clear as day! You click back to Beth's profile image and stifle a scream. The picture has changed. The background, the pose, the lighting, all stayed the same, but instead of your sister's smile that you saw when you first logged in, the stranger's face is grinning back at you. 'What the...' You click back and forth several times to be sure, your head reeling. 'Well,' you think, 'online images can be changed, but hard copies can't.' You log off, determined to find validation. You find the family photo album and head go to find your brother."); //11
storyContent.push("You knock lightly on your brother's door. 'Hey, Ben?' He glances up from his magazine and grunts an acknowledgement. You take that as encouragement and move further into the room. 'Have you noticed anything...weird about Beth? She seems different, doesn't she?' Ben considers this for a minute, then shrugs. 'Her hair's longer, I guess.' You refrain from rolling your eyes. 'It's more than just that,' you persist. 'I think... I don't think this is the real Beth,' you rush. Now you have Ben's full attention. He puts down his magazine carefully and sits up. You move forward with the photo album to lay out your evidence. 'I mean look at this, the facial structure has completely changed. That doesn't just happen. And when I hugged her today, she didn't even smell right. She didn't smell like Beth, you know?' Your brother nods his head carefully. 'I'll be right back,' he says, and darts out of the room before you can ask where he's going. He comes back a minute later, trailed by the rest of the family and fake-Beth. 'Sweetie?' your mom asks. 'What's going on?' You glare at your brother for his betrayal. So much for not alerting your parents, but maybe it's better to come clean. 'That's not Beth!' you declare, pointing at the imposter."); //12
storyContent.push("You pick a friend, Kathryn, that used to room with Beth, and shoot off an introductory message. She's one of the few school friends of Beth's that you've actually met before, although it was over a year ago. You're pleased when Kathryn responds back a minute later saying she remembers you. You decide to lead in slowly and see what information you can get: 'I'm kinda worried about Beth. Have you noticed anything off about her lately?' To your surprise, the response is immediate. 'OMG yes! shes been sooo strange lately!' Kathryn types. 'almost dont recognize her these past few months. idk whats up tho.' You press her for particulars, but all Kathryn adds is that Beth has been weird since she came back from the semester break. She makes no reference to Beth's completely different appearance, and signs off before you can ask. Still, it's a clue."); //13
storyContent.push("This is definitely worth looking into. The question is, do you go it alone, or involve your family? You need to find out when they last saw the real Beth. According to Kathryn, the big change occurred over the semester break. She should have been home during that time. You need information to move forward. Then again, you really don't need them freaking out and alerting the imposter. You're not sure who the fake is; she could be dangerous, in which case you don't want to alert her that you're onto her."); //14
storyContent.push("You may not be completely confident in your detective skills, but you know that your family is famously chatty. You're sure you'll be able to get them talking and get all you need to know without raising anyone's suspicions. They clearly don't realize anything's the matter, and it's probably best to keep it that way for now. It's pretty late to start poking around though, so you decide to put it off for the morning. While you're getting ready for bed, you begin a mental list of questions you want to ask. Before you know it, you've drifted off to sleep, mind still racing. The next think you know, you're wide awake, looking around blearily for whatever disturbed you. There: The door to your room has opened. A figure is watching you from the doorway."); //15
storyContent.push("You're in luck: The light's still on in your brother's room. 'Hey, Ben?' you call softly, knocking on the door. He pulls one earbud out with a disinterested, 'Yeah?' You pluck up your courage, closing the door behind you. 'Beth came home over her semester break, right?' He nods. 'Did you notice anything...different about her?' you persist. 'Like she's a completely different person, maybe?' Ben just shrugs, and you lose patience with his inattention. 'Can you tune in for like 5 seconds?' you snap. 'There's an imposter in our house! Our sister may be in danger, and you can't be bothered to pause your music!' Ben stares at you in shock. 'I'll be right back,' he says, and darts out of the room. He's back barely a minute later, trailed by the rest of the family and fake-Beth. 'Sweetie?' your mom asks. 'What's going on?' You glare at your brother for his betrayal. Didn't he realize you didn't go straight to your parents for a reason? Too late now. 'That's not Beth!' you declare, pointing at the imposter."); //16
storyContent.push("Your best bet is to sleep on it. Maybe you've had a mini stroke and something's off in your brain, or maybe you're just tired and not thinking straight. You haven't been sleeping well lately, after all. Maybe tonight you'll take a sleeping pill to refresh, and see what the morning brings. You really haven't seen Beth in a while, you remind yourself, and if her behavior has changed, that could throw off the way you're seeing her. With these reassuring thoughts, you get ready for bed. Hours later, you sluggishly surface from a drug-induced sleep. Your whole body feels heavy, like the air is too thick, and you struggle to move. Distantly, you realize someone is standing beside your bed, and you blink several times to focus on their face."); //17
storyContent.push("As soon as the dishes are done, you retrieve the family photo album from the living room and retreat to your bedroom. You sort through methodically, starting with baby pictures and working toward the present, comparing the ways that age and weight and different haircuts altered Beth's appearance over time. When you reach the most recent, last year's family holiday card, you pull out your phone and hold up the stealth shot you took of the Beth-imposter earlier that evening. You smile in triumph; the photos have spoken, and you have your evidence. They are not the same person. Your door creaks softly, and you jump, whipping your head around to see fake-Beth peering in. 'Hey,' she smiles, and you fight the urge to scream. She comes in and sits across from you, looking at the open album and the photos scattered across your lap. 'What are you doing?'"); //18
storyContent.push("'Confirming my suspicions,' you say bluntly. It's best to tackle this head on. One eyebrow goes up, but otherwise fake-Beth doesn't look surprised. 'What kind of suspicions?' Her tone is even. You brush right past her question. 'Who are you? And where's Beth?' 'I am Beth,' she says, but her mouth twitches like she's suppressing a smile. 'You're lying!' you yell. Her face morphs into a full-blown grin now, and she stands so she's towering above you. Whether from shock or something else, you can't move."); //19
storyContent.push("'Just feeling nostalgic,' you lie smoothly. 'Look how much we've grown!' You hand the imposter a photo of you and Beth from Beth's high school days. You watch closely to see if she'll react to the obvious difference in appearance. She smiles, touching the imagely lightly with one finger. 'It seems like just yesterday,' she sighs, handing it back. You hide your disappointment. 'I just wanted to say good night,' she continues. 'Maybe we can grab lunch this week? I've missed our sibling bonding time!' You roll your eyes good-naturedly, forgetting momentarily that this isn't actually Beth. 'If I HAVE to!' you tease, stopping abruptly when you remember. Her eyes narrow briefly, but the look is gone before you can blink. 'Great!' she smiles, standing up. You hold your breath until she's safely away in Beth's room. You glance down at the picture in your hand as you put it away. And look again. The image has changed: Instead of Beth, the picture shows your arm around a younger-looking version of the imposter."); //20
storyContent.push("Yes, a little sleep is all you need. You push aside all the worry and refuse to dwell on the strange happenings of the day as you go about your regular nightly routine. You fall asleep imagining that this has all been a  bad dream and you'll wake up to Beth, the real Beth, making her famous chocolate chip pancakes. A few hours later, you jolt awake from a real nightmare. You had dreamed your sister was locked up in a medieval prison and calling for you to help. You shake your head to get rid of the dream, and notice your bedroom door is open. 'I thought I closed that,' you think, and that's when you notice the figure standing at the foot of your bed."); //21
storyContent.push("The Internet has all the answers! Or you used to think so. Ignoring the late hour, you type query after query into your search engine. You learn much more than you ever cared to about film development and dark rooms, but it seems the technology you're looking for doesn't exist. You conclude that it shouldn't be possible for someone to physically change a photo with that level of detail at only a touch. At your wit's end, you make an anonymous blog post describing the whole mysterious phenomenon, imposter and all. You even share 'before and after' photos that clearly show the two different Beths. You get a lot of comments like, 'cool pics how bout w/out clothes ??' and 'u crazy they the same' but one response in particular catches your eye: 'Very different. You're not crazy but you have to act fast. Call me 4948675309'. The same username commented once more, just below that: 'They took my brother.'"); //22
storyContent.push("You finally glance at the clock, and let out a low whistle. It's after 4am; way past bedtime. Feeling discouraged, you trudge through the motions and collapse into bed. Maybe tomorrow will be better, you think."); //23
storyContent.push("Distant yelling wakes you, and you squint at your alarm clock. 7am! No way are you getting up; you're on vacation. You're about to slip back to sleep when the events of yesterday come flooding back, and you snap awake. Beth. The muffled yelling gets louder, and you lurch to your feet. The imposter! You race through the hall to find your family and save them from fake-Beth, but you're brought up short at the front door. A crazed man in a tinfoil hat is yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to speak to you. His foot is wedged in the door to keep it open despite your dad's attempts to shove him out. Feeling a spike of guilt, you jump to help and manage to get the door shut. The man continues yelling outside, and your mom hastily assures the room that the cops are already on their way. Avoiding everyone, you stumble back to your room and collapse on your bed. How did that belligerent man find you? Your bedroom door opens and closes. 'I don't know who he is or why he came here,' you sigh to preempt the questions, but you're met with silence."); //24
storyContent.push("You sit in the near-dark of your room, lit only by your computer screen, waiting for the author of the mysterious comments to pickup. When he finally does, you don't know what to say. 'Hi,' you start, but he takes it from there. 'Are you alone? Good. There's no time to waste. Does the fake know that you know? No? Good; don't tell it. Now listen very carefully.' The tinny voice weaves a surprisingly vivid story of a changeling brother and clueless parents, and you find yourself nodding along. When he's finished, you sit spellbound for a moment. 'Well?' the man prompts across the line."); //25
storyContent.push("'I'm sorry,' you tell him, 'I don't think this is the same thing at all.' You're proud of your tone: polite but firm. 'Wait!' the man yells into the phone. You wince, pulling it away from your ear a bit. 'You have to believe me, please! You can't let Them get to you! You can't let Them win!!' His paranoia makes you frown; good thing you didn't trust him, if he's this crazy. He's still ranting, loudly, but you hang up. It was a long shot anyway, you comfort yourself. There's nothing for it now but to get some well-needed rest and keep going tomorrow. You can barely keep your eyes open as it is."); //26
storyContent.push("'That's exactly the way it happened to me!' you exclaim. The line is silent for a moment. 'I'm sorry to hear that,' the man says at last, and he truly sounds sorry. 'I don't know if there's a way to get your sister back, but I do know we need to move quickly to get you to safety. We need to meet right away.'"); //27
storyContent.push("You may be trusting, but you're not stupid. 'I don't think that's a good idea,' you tell the man. 'We can talk on the phone, but that's it.' There's a beat of silence over the phone before he speaks again. 'You don't want to meet?' He sounds incredulous. 'But we need to get you somewhere safe! You can't stay where you are if They are around, especially not now! You know too much! You're a threat!' He was planning to take you 'somewhere safe'? This was beginning to sound like a thinly-veiled kidnappeing attempt. Good thing you decided not to go. 'Look, I'm sorry-' you begin, but he cuts you off, growing more frantic. 'You don't understand! You have to! You can't stay or They'll get you too! They'll-' You hang up before he can finish, congratulating yourself on a good judgment call. The man was clearly unhinged. Yawning, you frown at the clock. You'd better get some sleep if you plan to be functional tomorrow."); //28
storyContent.push("'Okay...' you say tentatively. The man is all business. Within a few minutes you have a designated meeting point: a tiny park a short distance from your house. You glance at your clock and grimace. The plan is to meet in 20 minutes. Looks like you're not getting much sleep tonight. You grab a sweatshirt from the back of your chair and head for the door. If you get there early you can hide and get a good look at the strange man before deciding whether or not to show yourself. Safety first. You ease your door open and peek out carefully. The hallway is dark, but you think you see a slight glow coming from under Beth's door. Maybe fake-Beth is doing some late night Internet research as well. You shrug it off and follow the familiar path from your adolescence, instinctively avoiding the creaky spots on the stairs and heading straight for the oiled window. With barely a backwards glance, you make for the park."); //29
storyContent.push("You're well hidden in the bushes across the street from the park when the man shows up. He seems fine from what you can tell: medium build, decently dressed, no bulky coat that might hide a weapon. You decide to risk it. At the appointed time, you steal out from behind the bushes and approach the man quietly from behind. He turns around right before you reach him and doesn't seem surprised that you've just popped out of nowhere. 'Oh good, you made it,' he says. You're taken aback; his voice sounds very different from the low, if tinny, growl on the phone. In fact, up close, he looks much too young to be the man you spoke to. He grins as you start to back away. 'You're not-' you start, but you choke off as the man's face begins to distort and melt. You gasp and turn to run, but something knocks you flat."); //30
